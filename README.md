A Variable Strategy Reinforced Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun Algorithm (VSR-LKH)
----
This repository contains code to reproduce results from the paper: <br> <br>
Combining Reinforcement Learning with Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (AAAI 2021) <br>
Jiongzhi Zheng, Kun He, Jianrong Zhou, Yan Jin, Chu-min Li <br> <br>

Installation
----
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: <br> <br>

cd VSR-LKH <br>
make <br> <br>

An executable file called LKH will now be available in the directory VSR-LKH. <br>
Then enter the .par file name corresponding to the TSP instance, such as u574.par, to run the program.
